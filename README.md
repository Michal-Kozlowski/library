# library

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

### docs folder and library.html
library.html is the same as index.html, but it links to the docs folder build.js (exactly same file as build.js in dist). This files are here only to make github pages work.
